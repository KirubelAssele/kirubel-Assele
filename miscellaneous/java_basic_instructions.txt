Since there were issues with using Java, here are simple instructions on how to install and use it,
plus reference links.

---About Java
Compiling is turning your source code into instruction in machine language so that the computer can execute it.
Java is a language that once compiled produces an executable that is coded for a virtual machine.
Contrary to C/C++, compiled Java code will not work directly on a computer. It will need to be interpreted by a virtual machine.
This makes it so that you only need one compiled version that can work on every Java Virtual Machine,
contrary to C/C++ where you have to compile a different version for every physical machine.

---Install Java
To program in Java you will need two things:
The Java Runtime Environment or JRE, and the Java Development Kit or JDK
You can install both from the Oracle website:
If your windows is 64 bits
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html

Otherwise (32 bits, x86)
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

---Program in Java
You can learn how to write a simple Hello World program and compile it with this page:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/cupojava/win32.html

You can use any text editor to program in Java, but I would recommend Notepad++ to do this exercise.
If you program in a text editor, you must use an external program to compile and launch your code.
On Windows, you can do SHIFT+RIGHT-CLICK in any FOLDER to bring up the special menu option "OPEN A CONSOLE/TERMINAL/SHELL/COMMAND WINDOW HERE"

Here are some basic command line tips:

---Advanced:  Install an IDE
NetBeans, Eclipse are what we call IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
You can perfectly program only using a text editor, but sometimes you need a more advanced tool: this is the IDE.
An IDE is a heavier program that does much more than allow you to type text: it will color it, check for syntax errors, 
help you manage your files, give you documentation. You can also do debugging trough it!
Installing an IDE and learning to use it can take some time. But there is a lot of free documentation online on how to do it.


______________

Once you are setup to start programming, I will ask you to write a program to verify that the numbers in a file are sorted
(each number is bigger than the previous one)

For this, you will:
1)Import Reader_simple
2)Open "increasing_data.txt" using Reader_simple (download it from the repository)
3)Read every integer in "increasing_data.txt" and verify that it is sorted (download it from the repository)
4)Make a function that will return true or false depending on if the file is sorted or not
5)Try it on "not_increasing_data.txt" ! It should return false.

Notes: 
-To verify if a list is sorted, verify that each new number is bigger _or equal_ to the previous one
-To read a file, we loop until there is nothing to read. Here is the code:
	try{
		while(true){
			old_int = new_int;
			new_int = my_reader.read();
			//your code here
		}
	}
	catch (EOFException e){
		//end of file exception	
	}
	
If you have questions (even dumb ones!), ask me!
It's better to ask than to get stuck and waste time.
